# Wing Chutes

## Requirements

You will need mcbuild (https://mcbuild.dev/) in order to build this, but there are prebuilt releases available at https://github.com/technobaboo/wing-chutes/releases.

## Building

Building is fairly simple, just run `pack.sh` on Linux.

On Windows it is slightly harder, but using mcbuild to build `datapack` and creating a zip file from the `resourcepack` folder and copying `datapack/data` and `datapack/pack.mcmeta` to the appropriate folders should do it.
